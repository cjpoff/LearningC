Getting started with C - The Absolute Basics
============================================

This is a basic repo so I can learn both Git, GitHub, and C all at once.

I started learning programming in my first year at Uni in Fall, 2002, but dropped out after a year due to personal family reasons.

After over 20 years, I returned to uni and finished my degree in Cyber Security.

Now, I'm going to teach myself C and the move on to other languages.
